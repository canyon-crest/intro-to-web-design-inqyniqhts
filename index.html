        <h3>Who am I? :0 spooky aka my brag paragraph</h3>
            <p class="pink"><img src="images/school.jpeg" id="pic1" class="smaller">As of 2025, Iâ€™m a 10th grade student at <a href="https://cc.sduhsd.net/" target="_blank">CCA</a> who is currently extremely occupied with all my AP/Honors classes going on. Something to know about me is that I have a lot of drive and passion towards trying new things and excelling in different subjects like business and science. Specifically, I love going out and exploring various competitions like Science Olympiad, Deca, and Future Business Leaders of America.  Last year at CCA, I placed 6th place at DECA SoCal in Apparel and Accessories Marketing and then 6th place again at DECA California State conference for Human Resource Management, only 1 place away from one of the upperclassmen at CCA. This meant a lot to me as a freshman last year because I even qualified for the International Career Development Conference for DECA that year, and it was honestly such an amazing achievement. Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t go last year but Iâ€™m hoping to qualify again this year! </p>
        <h3>Helenâ€™s Hobbies, Likes, and Dislikes</h3>
            <p><img src="images/grunge.jpeg" class="smaller">  In my free time, <span class="highlight">I love to sing various pop songs</span> and follow/analyze singers and their pop culture fandoms. Some of my favorite singers are Lady Gaga and Marina, since I admire their vocal range and singing styles. Additionally, I like drawing people, figures, cartoons, etc. Hand in hand with pop and art, I have an affinity for fashion and designing clothes. While Iâ€™m not interested in making physical arts/wearable apparel, the designing aspect is very thrilling and intuitive to me. I also appreciate extreme fashion and various aesthetics, like coquette, kidcore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_kei" target="_blank">visual kei</a> , lolita, and more. </p>
        <h3>Goals for the future :D</h3>
            <p class="pink"><img src="images/deca.jpeg" id="pic3" class="smaller"> Moving forward, I would like to strengthen my knowledge of the French language and become a more organized person. Specifically, I plan to make a planner and schedule for the rest of the year so I can tackle my workload more efficiently. I would also like to become less doubtful and more optimistic about the future, rather than using a depressive lens for viewing situations. Iâ€™d also like to get a driverâ€™s permit in the near future and explore more internship opportunities as I move up various grades in high school. I am planning on pursuing a business focused career and I hope to become more experienced in this topic through attending DECA and <a href="https://www.fbla.org/" target="_blank">Future Business Leaders of America</a> again this year, along with an Advanced Business Management class I will be taking in semester 2. <span class="highlight">I hope that one day I can look back on my goals and know that they have been fulfilled</span>, and Iâ€™m excited to see where I go! </p>
